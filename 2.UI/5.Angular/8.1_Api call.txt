Q1. What is HttpClient and its benefits?

Most of the Front-end applications communicate with backend services over HTTP protocol using either XMLHttpRequest interface or the fetch() API. 
Angular provides a simplified client HTTP API known as HttpClient which is based on top of XMLHttpRequest interface. 

This client is avaialble from 
@angular/common/http package. 
You can import in your root module as below,
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';

The major advantages of HttpClient can be listed as below,

Contains testability features
Provides typed request and response objects
Intercept request and response
Supports Observalbe APIs
Supports streamlined error handling.

Q2. Explain on how to use HttpClient with an example?
Below are the steps need to be followed for the usage of HttpClient.
1. Import HttpClient into root module:
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    // import HttpClientModule after BrowserModule.
    HttpClientModule,
  ],
  ......
  })
 export class AppModule {}


2. Inject the HttpClient into the application: 
Let's create a userProfileService(userprofile.service.ts) as an example. 
It also defines get method of HttpClient
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

const userProfileUrl: string = 'assets/data/profile.json';

@Injectable()
export class UserProfileService {
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }

  getUserProfile() {
    return this.http.get(this.userProfileUrl);
  }
}


3. Create a component for subscribing service: 
Let's create a component called UserProfileComponent(userprofile.component.ts).
This will inject UserProfileService and invokes the service method,

fetchUserProfile() {
  this.userProfileService.getUserProfile()
    .subscribe((data: User) => this.user = {
        id: data['userId'],
        name: data['firstName'],
        city:  data['city']
    });
}

Since the above service method returns an Observable which needs to be subscribed in the component.
