Q6. Pure and impure pipes?
Pure pipe detect only pure changes. (pure change means change in primitive data value or the change in reference)
A pure pipe is only called when Angular detects a change in the value of the parameters passed to a pipe. 
For example, any changes to a primitive input value (String, Number, Boolean, Symbol) or a changed object reference (Date, Array, Function, Object). 
.
An impure pipe is called for every change detection cycle no matter whether the value or parameters changes. 
i.e, An impure pipe is called often, as often as every keystroke or mouse-move.
