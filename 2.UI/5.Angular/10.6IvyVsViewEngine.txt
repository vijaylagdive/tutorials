View Engine and Ivy are two rendering engines used in Angular to render components and templates. 
The View Engine is the original rendering engine that was introduced with Angular 2.
Ivy is the latest rendering engine introduced with Angular 9.


Overview of View Engine
View Engine is the original rendering engine in Angular that has been used since Angular 2. 
It is responsible for transforming Angular component templates into JavaScript code that can be executed by the browser. 
The main job of the View Engine is to compile components and templates into a set of instructions that can be understood and rendered by the browser. 
View Engine also handles the dependency injection system and provides services like change detection, directives, and pipes.

Overview of Ivy
Ivy is the latest rendering engine in Angular that was introduced with Angular 9. 
It is a complete overhaul of the View Engine, with the aim of making Angular faster, smaller, and more flexible. 
The main focus of Ivy is on better performance and smaller bundle sizes. 
Ivy achieves this by generating more efficient code that eliminates unnecessary elements from the compiled templates.


Differences between View Engine and Ivy
There are several differences between View Engine and Ivy:

1.Compilation and Code Generation: 
View Engine uses a two-phase compilation process.
The first phase compiles the template into a component factory. 
The second phase creates the view from the component factory. 
.
Ivy, on the other hand, uses a single-phase compilation process that generates code directly from the template.


2. Tree Shaking: 
View Engine does not support tree shaking.
.
Ivy enables tree shaking, a process that eliminates unnecessary code from the compiled output. 
This makes the code smaller, and the application runs faster. 

3. Debugging: 
Debugging with Ivy is easier since it provides more detailed error messages, source maps, and better tooling support. 
View Engine does not provide such detailed error messages.

4. Performance: 
Ivy provides better performance than View Engine. 
It does this by generating more efficient code, enabling tree shaking, and using a smaller bundle size.

IVY:
Single phase compilation
Tree shaking 
Better debugging with detailed error handling.
Better performance with tree shaking, using smaller bundle size.
