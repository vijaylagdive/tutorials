Starts from angular.json
Angular.json
When the application first starts Angular looks for this file.
Once Angular found the file it starts looking for the 'main' node which is under architect -> build -> options.
"main":"src/main.ts"
The value of the main node is a file path that Angular is looking for - the main.ts under src folder.
------------------------
main.ts
In this file the function 

platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule).catch(err => console.error(err));

creates the platform.
This function is also used to bootstrap the Angular Application. 
Here we specify the first module that should be loaded when the application starts for the first time - the root module. 
In other words the bootstrapping module.
------------------------
app.module.ts
Once angular finds the starting module the app.module.ts (where all the components/ directives/ pipes associated to this module is present and dependency to other module is also present) 
it looks for the bootstrap option - bootstrap: [AppComponent]

Where the starting component name has been specified - in this case the AppComponent.
By now Angular compiler has all the required information it needs to work.
------------------------
index.html

Now the index.html is loaded and starts parsing. 
Now all the componets are already ready.
Once it finds the selector it exactly knows which component to load and the AppComponent is displayed in the screen.
And that's it. This is how the application starts.
