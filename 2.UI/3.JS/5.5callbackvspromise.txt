Callback Hell (Callback Pyramid): 
Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to another function and are executed when that function completes its task. 
Callbacks can lead to a phenomenon known as "callback hell" or "callback pyramid" when you have multiple nested callbacks, making the code hard to read and maintain.

asyncFunction1((result1) => {
  asyncFunction2(result1, (result2) => {
    asyncFunction3(result2, (result3) => {
      // ... and so on
    });
  });
});


Error Handling: 
Error handling in callbacks can be challenging because you need to check for errors in each callback, which can lead to repetitive error-handling code.

Limited Composition: 
Composing multiple asynchronous operations can be tricky with callbacks, as you have to manage the flow manually.

Promise:
Chaining: Promises provide a more structured way to handle asynchronous operations by allowing you to chain .then() and .catch() methods. 
This leads to cleaner and more readable code.

asyncFunction1()
  .then(result1 => asyncFunction2(result1))
  .then(result2 => asyncFunction3(result2))
  .then(result3 => {
    // ...
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle errors
  });

Error Handling: Promises make error handling more straightforward by allowing you to handle errors using the .catch() method at the end of the chain.

Composition: Promises are composable, meaning you can combine multiple promises using functions like Promise.all() and Promise.race() to coordinate and manage complex asynchronous flows.

Async/Await: Promises are often used with the async/await syntax, which provides a more synchronous-looking code structure while still being asynchronous under the hood.

async function doSomething() {
  try {
    const result1 = await asyncFunction1();
    const result2 = await asyncFunction2(result1);
    const result3 = await asyncFunction3(result2);
    // ...
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors
  }
}

In modern JavaScript, promises are generally preferred over callbacks due to their cleaner syntax, better error handling, and improved composability. 
However, callbacks are still used in some situations, especially in older codebases or when dealing with APIs that rely on callbacks.
