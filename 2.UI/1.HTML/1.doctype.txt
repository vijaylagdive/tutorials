Q4. What is <!DOCTYPE html> elements
Ans:
1. Document type declaration is an instruction that tells the web browser about the markup language in which the current page is written. 
2. Lets the browser know about the version or standard of HTML or any other markup language that is being used in the document.

What happens if Doctype is not given?
The absence of the DOCTYPE or its incorrect usage will force the browser to switch to quirks mode. 
It means that the browser will do its best to layout the page that is considered to be old or created against web standards
For example: new features & tags in HTML5 such as <article>,< footer >, <header>,<nav>, <section> may not be supported if the <!DOCTYPE> is not declared.
