Q1. What is spring boot? Features or Advantages of Spring boot?
Ans:
- Spring boot is module of spring with which we speed up the development.
- It provides an easier and faster way to set up, configure, and run both simple   and web-based application.
- It provides auto configuration and embeded application server like tomcat,jetty   etc.
- It basically removes a lot of configuration and dependencies.
- SpringFramework + Embeded Servers - Configurations = Spring Boot
- Absolutely no code generations and not requirement for XML configuration.
- Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration.
- This allowins developers to focus more on writing business logic rather than dealing with complex setup and configuration details.


Features or Advantages:
Auto Configuration:
It provides auto-configuration, where common components and dependencies are   automatically configured based on classpath scanning and sensible defaults.

Starter Dependencies:
Spring Boot offers a curated set of starter dependencies that include all thenecessary libraries for specific functionalities.
It reducing the effort of managing dependencies manually.

Embeded Servers:
It comes with an embedded server, such as Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow, allowing developers to run applications as standalone JAR files without
requiring a separate web server installation.

Spring Boot Actuator:
Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features out of the box, such as health checks, metrics, and monitoring capabilities.
It offers a range of developer tools, including automatic restart, live reload, and a command-line interface (CLI), 
enhancing productivity during the development process.

Q2. What is the difference between Spring, Spring MVC and Spring Boot?
Ans: 
1. Spring:
- Spring is a comprehensive framework for building Java applications.
- Spring's core focus is on providing infrastructure support for building enterprise-level applications.
- It can be used for both web and non-web applications.
- It provides a wide range of features and modules for various aspects of application development, such as:
1.Dependency injection, 
2.Aspect-oriented programming, 
3.Transaction management, 
4.Data access, messaging, and more.
------------------------
2. Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller):
- Spring MVC is a specific module within the Spring Framework designed for building web applications.
- It follows the MVC architectural pattern, which separates an application into three components: 
1. Model (business logic and data), 
2. View (presentation layer), 
3. Controller (request handling and flow control).

- Spring MVC provides features and components tailored for handling HTTP requests, managing URL mappings, processing form submissions, and rendering views for web applications.
- It's used when you want to create web applications and need a framework that helps you structure the application's architecture and handle web-specific concerns.
- In summary, Spring is the broader framework that encompasses various features for building Java applications, 
while Spring MVC is a specific module within Spring dedicated to web application development, 
focusing on the MVC pattern and providing tools for handling web-related tasks. 
- Developers often use both Spring and Spring MVC together when building web applications within the Spring ecosystem.
------------------------
3. SpringBoot:
- Spring Boot, on the other hand, is a sub-project of the Spring Framework that aims to simplify the development process.
- It simplifies development by providing opinionated defaults and auto-configuration. 
- It uses the capabilities of the Spring Framework while minimizing the need for explicit configuration. 
- Spring Boot focuses on convention over configuration and provides a streamlined approach to building stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications.
