Q2. application.properties file in springboot?
Ans:
- In a Spring Boot application, the application.properties file is a configuration file used to configure various properties and settings for your application. 
- It is used to configure various aspects of your Spring Boot application, such as database connection settings, server port, logging levels, and much more.
- The file is typically written in a key-value pair format, where keys are used to specify configuration properties, 
  and values are used to set the corresponding values for those properties. 

For example:
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
spring.datasource.username=myuser
spring.datasource.password=mypassword
server.port=8080
logging.level.root=INFO
