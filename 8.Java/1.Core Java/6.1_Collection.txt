Collections in Java
The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.

Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.

Java Collection means a single unit of objects. Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).

Framework:
A framework is set of classes and interface which provide a ready-made architecture.

Collection Framework:
Collection framework is Java API which provides architecture to store and manipulate group of object.


Collection(Interface): Provides three interfaces List, Queue, Set

1. List(Interface): 
Indexed collection[0,1,2]. 
Order is preserved.
Duplicates are allowed.
List provides its 3 implementation classes:
1. ArrayList: dynamic array, non thread safe
2. LinkedList:
3. Vector: dynamic, additional features, thread safe.
   Vector provides stack
------------------------
2. Queue

------------------------
3. Set(Interface):
It provides SortedSet which is implemented by TreeSet
And classes like HashSet and LinkedHashSet

Featues of set are:
Not indexed collection.
Order not preserved.
Duplicates are not allowed.
Hashset(class)
LinkedHashSet(class)
