Multithreading:
Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU. Each part of such program is called a thread. So, threads are light-weight processes within a process.

Threads can be created by using two mechanisms : 
1.Extending the Thread class 
syntax:
class Thread {
}
Example:
class Mythread extends Thread
{
	public void run()
	{
		//task
	}
}


------------------------
2.Implementing the Runnable Interface
syntax:
Intreface Runnable {
	run()
}
Example:
class MyThread implements Runnable
{
	public void run()
	{
		//task
	}

}

MyThread t = new MyThread();
Thread thread = new Thread(t)
thread.start()

-------------------

Thread class provide methods to perform operations with Threads.
This thread class is present in java.lang package.
So we dont need to import this package.
Important Methods:
public string getName(): return name of the thread.
public void setName(String name): set name of the thread.
public void run(): contains the task of thread.
public void start(): start the thread by allocationg resources.
public long getId(): return the id of thread.
setPriority(p), getPriority();
sleep(), join(),interrupt(), resume() stop() 


-------------------
Daemon thread:
Daemon thread in java is service provider thread that provides service to the thread user.

setDaemon(Boolean)

public Boolean isDaemon()

Garbage collector is best example of Daemon thread.

Example:

class TestDaemonThread1 extends Thread{
    public void run(){  
         if(Thread.currentThread().isDaemon()){//checking for daemon thread  
            System.out.println("daemon thread work");  
         }  
         else {  
            System.out.println("user thread work");  
         }
    }
    

    public static void main(String[] args){  
        TestDaemonThread1 t1=new TestDaemonThread1();//creating thread  
        TestDaemonThread1 t2=new TestDaemonThread1();  
        TestDaemonThread1 t3=new TestDaemonThread1();  
        
        t1.setDaemon(true);//now t1 is daemon thread  
          
        t1.start();//starting threads  
        t2.start();  
        t3.start();  
       }  
}
