HTML Entities
Some characters are reserved in HTML.

If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.

Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.

A character entity looks like this:

&entity_name;
OR

&#entity_number;
To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60;
