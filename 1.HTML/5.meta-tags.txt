Q3. What are the meta tags definition and Usage
Ans:

1. The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.
2. They always go inside the <head> element.
3. They typically used to specify:
  a. character set  <meta charset="UTF-8"/> : Specifies the character encoding for the HTML document
  b. page description, 
  c. keywords, 
  d. author of the document, 
  e. viewport settings.
4. Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.
5. Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.


meta tags examples:
1. Define keyword for search engine:
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">

2. Define description of your web page
<meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials for HTML and CSS">

3. Define author of the page:
<meta name="author" content="John Doe">

4. Refresh document every 30 seconds.
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">

5. Setting the viewport to make your website look good on all devices:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">


ViewPort in details
1. There is a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page), through the <meta> tag.

2. Viewport: The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

3. <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

4. This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

5. The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

6. The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
