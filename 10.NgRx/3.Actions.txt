Action:
Action is standardized message(event) to which reducers can listen.
The application must dispatch an action in order to update the state of a Store. 
A reducer, also known as a pure function, identifies this action, updates the state, and returns a new, immutable state object. 
As an example of an action, consider the following:

const action = {
    type: 'ADD_EMPLOYEES',
    payload: {
        name: 'John',
        competency: ['ASP.NET', 'Angular']
    }
};
