Q: What is NgRx Selectors?
Ans:
- Selectors are pure functions that receive state slices as input parameters and return state data slices for components to consume. 
- The Selectors are the ngrx/store module's query tools, similar to how databases have their own SQL query language.


Below example uses a query and return the array of Employees from the state using a selector:

  constructor(private store: Store<{ counter: number }>) {
    this.count$ = store.select('counter');
  }


export const getAllEmployees = createSelector(getState, (state): Employees[] => {
        return state && state.employees;
    }
);

....
....

this.store.select<Employees[]>(getAllEmployees).subscribe(
    employees=> console.log(developers)
);

Every Feature module in an Angular application is responsible for injecting its own state into the root application state. 
As a result, the state is a tree of properties with sub-properties, and so on. 
To avoid manually traversing the state tree every time the Store composes a new state and informs components, you define selectors at different levels of the state tree.
