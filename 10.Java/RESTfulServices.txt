RESTful services: REST - Representational State Transfer
REST services, are a set of architectural principles and constraints for designing web services which is widely adopted now. 
It is the basis for how the World Wide Web itself operates.

Key principles and constraints of RESTful services include:

Stateless: 
Communication between the client and server should be stateless.
That means each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. 
The server should not store any client state between requests. 
This allows for greater scalability and reliability since any server can handle any client request.

Client-Server: 
REST separates the client from the server, allowing them to evolve independently. 
This separation of concerns simplifies the architecture and makes it more scalable.

Uniform Interface: 
RESTful services should have a uniform and consistent interface.
This typically includes a limited set of well-defined operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and the use of standard URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) to identify resources.

Resource-Based: 
In a RESTful system, resources (e.g., data objects or entities) are identified by URIs. 
These resources can be manipulated using standard HTTP methods. 
For example, a RESTful API for a library might have resources like books and authors, each with its own URI.

Representation: 
Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON, XML, or HTML, and clients can request the representation they prefer. 
The representation should contain enough information for the client to understand and interact with the resource.

Layered System: 
A RESTful system can be composed of multiple layers, where each layer has a specific role or responsibility. 
This allows for better scalability and flexibility.

RESTful services are commonly used in the design of web APIs, where resources are accessed and manipulated using HTTP methods. 
For example, a RESTful API for a social media platform might use GET requests to retrieve user profiles, POST requests to create new posts, PUT requests to update existing posts, and DELETE requests to remove posts.

Overall, RESTful services provide a straightforward and scalable way to build networked applications and web services by leveraging the principles of the World Wide Web's architecture.
