Q1. What is starter dependencies in springboot?
In Spring Boot, starter dependencies are a convenient and opinionated way to manage dependencies in your application. 
Starter dependencies are a set of pre-configured, ready-to-use dependencies.
This dependencies you can include in your Spring Boot project to quickly set up and bootstrap specific functionality or features. 

Here are some key points about Spring Boot starter dependencies:

1. Pre-configured Dependencies: 
Each starter dependency includes a carefully curated set of libraries and configuration settings related to a particular use case or feature. 
These dependencies are designed to work seamlessly together, so you don't need to manually select and configure individual libraries.

2. Opinionated Defaults: 
Spring Boot follows the principle of "opinionated defaults," meaning it provides sensible default configurations and settings for common use cases. 
Starter dependencies embody these opinions by configuring the libraries they include in a way that aligns with best practices and common patterns.

3. Simplified Dependency Management: 
Instead of searching for and adding individual dependencies one by one, you can simply include a starter dependency in your project's build file (e.g., Maven or Gradle). 
Spring Boot's dependency management will automatically manage the versioning and compatibility of these libraries, reducing the potential for version conflicts.

4. Naming Convention: 
Starter dependencies follow a naming convention, typically in the format of spring-boot-starter-*, 
where * is the name of the feature or functionality. 
e.g. spring-boot-starter-web includes dependencies for building web applications.

5. Customization: 
While starter dependencies provide pre-configured defaults, you can still customize and override the configurations according to your specific requirements. 
Spring Boot allows you to fine-tune the behavior by providing properties and additional configuration options.

Example Starters: Some commonly used starter dependencies include:
spring-boot-starter-web: For building web applications with Spring MVC.
spring-boot-starter-data-jpa: For working with JPA-based data access.
spring-boot-starter-security: For adding security features to your application.
spring-boot-starter-test: For testing your Spring Boot application.
