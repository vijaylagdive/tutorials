4. Spring boot command line interface.

Setting up the CLI: By using SDKMAN, the Spring Boot CLI (Command-Line Interface) can be directly installed!

Employing the CLI: Once the CLI has been installed, you can launch it by typing spring and hitting Enter.

Launch a New project: By using start.spring.io and the init command, you can initiate a new project without leaving the shell.

Using the Embedded Shell: For the BASH and zsh shells, Spring Boot provides command-line completion routines.
