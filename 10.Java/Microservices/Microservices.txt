Disadvantages of Monolithic Applications:
1. As project scale, it becomes difficult to manage.
2. For single change redeployment of whole application needed.
3. Difficult to adapt new technology for single functionality.
4. Single bug may down your whole application.


Advantages of Monolithic Applications:
1.Simple to develope.
2.Simple to build and deploy.
3.Problem of network latency are relatively less. network latency occurs when    microservices are on different servers.


What are microservices.
1.Microservices are the small services that work together.
2.These are smaller services communicating with each other directly using light    weight protocols like HTTP.

Advantages of microservices:
- It is possible to change or upgrade each service individually rather than upgrading the entire application.
- If any service is down will not impact another.
- Can use easily different technologies for building different microservices.
- Less dependency on other modules. Loosely coupled.

How Microservices contact each other:
M1 <---> HTTP/REST <----> M2
