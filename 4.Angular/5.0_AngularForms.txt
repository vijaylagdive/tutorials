Q3. Difference between Template and Reactive form?
Ans:
Feature: Form model setup
Reactive: Created(FormControl instance) in component explicitly
TD Form : Created by directives

Feature: Data updates
Reactive: Synchronous
TD Form: Asynchronous

Feature: Form custom validation
Reactive: Defined as Functions
TD Form : Defined as Directives

Feature: Testing
Reactive: No interaction with change detection cycle	
TD Form : Need knowledge of the change detection process

Feature: Mutability
Reactive: Immutable(by always returning new value for FormControl instance)
TD Form : Mutable(Property always modified to new value)

Feature: Scalability
Reactive: More scalable using low-level APIs	
TD Form : Less scalable using due to abstraction on APIs

Q6. Why check dirty and touched?
You may not want your application to display errors before the user has a chance to edit the form. 
The checks for dirty and touched prevent errors from showing until the user does one of two things: 
a) changes the value, turning the control dirty;  b)or blurs the form control element, setting the control to touched.

Q7. Show hide password on click of button?
Ans:
<input [type]="show ? 'text' : 'password'" />

<button (click)="password()">{{show ? 'Show' : 'Hide'}}</button>

// variable - default false
show: boolean = false;

constructor() {
}

// click event function toggle
password() {
    this.show = !this.show;
}
