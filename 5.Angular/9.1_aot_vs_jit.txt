Angular offers two ways to compile your application,
Just-in-Time (JIT)
Ahead-of-Time (AOT)
------------------
What is JIT?
1. Just-in-Time (JIT) is a type of compilation that compiles your app in the browser at runtime. 
2. Just in time compiler provides compilation during the execution of the program at a run time before execution. 
3. In simple words, code get compiled when it’s needed, not at the build time.
4. JIT compilation is the default when you run the ng build (build only) or ng serve (build and serve locally) CLI commands. 
i.e, the below commands used for JIT compilation,
ng build
ng serve

Why and When Should you use Just In Time Compiler ?
1. Just in time compiler compiles each file separately and it’s mostly compiled in the browser.
2. You don’t have to build your project again after changing your code.
3. Most compiling is done on the browser side, so it will take less compiling time.
4. If you have a big project or a situation where some of your components don’t come in use most of 
  the time then you should use the Just in time compiler.
5. Just in Time compiler is best when your application is in local development.

A few important points:
- Then if the functionality is need in your project and it’s not in compiled code, that function or component will be compiled.
- This process will help to reduce the burden on the CPU and make your app render fast.
- One more interesting thing is, you can see and link to your source code in inspect mode because Just in Time, 
compiles your code with JIT mode and a map file.

jit
1. compile at runtime in the browser
2. larger angular bundle size
3. detect template error later at runtime.
4. slower rendering 
5. more asynchronous request
6. less security
7. less performance
8. good for development
9. ng serve

aot
1. compile at build time
2. smaller angular bundle files size.
3. detect template errors earlier at compile time.
4. faster rendering 
5. les asynchronous request
6. better security
7. better performance
8. good for production
9. ng build --aot
