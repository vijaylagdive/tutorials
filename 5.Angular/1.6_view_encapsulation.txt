What is view encapsulation.
This defines template and style encapsulation options available for an Angular component. 
There are three options available for view encapsulation:

In Angular, a component's styles can be encapsulated within the component's host element so that they don't affect the rest of the application.

The Component decorator provides the encapsulation option which can be used to control how the encapsulation is applied on a per component basis.

e.g.
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None
})

ViewEncapsulation.Emulated:
In this Angular modifies the component's CSS selectors.
So that they are only applied to the component's view and do not affect other elements in the application.


ViewEncapsulation.None
Angular does not apply any sort of view encapsulation 
It means that any styles specified for the component are actually globally applied and can affect any HTML element present within the application. 
This mode is same as including the styles into the HTML itself.

ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDom
Angular does not apply any sort of view encapsulation.
Meaning that any styles specified for the component are actually globally applied and can affect any HTML element present within the application. 
This mode is essentially the same as including the styles into the HTML itself.
