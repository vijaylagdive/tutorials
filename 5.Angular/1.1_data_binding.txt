Q3. Data binding:
Data biniding means communication between your Typescript(business logic) and HTML template.

Below 4 types of data binding in angular:
a. String Interpolation
b. Property Binding,
c. Event Binding,
d. Two Way Data Binding.

a. String Interpolation:  
Interpolation allows you to incorporate calculated strings into the text between HTML element tags and within attribute assignments.
e.g. {{title}},  {{2+3}} will show 5

b. Property Binding(Component to DOM)
In Angular, property binding is a way to bind a component property to an element property or attribute in the template. It allows you to set the value of an element property dynamically based on the value of a component property.
The syntax for property binding in Angular uses square brackets ([]) within the element's

public allowServer : boolean = true;

<button [disabled]="!allowServer">
  Click Me
</button>

<p [innerText="allowServer"]></p>

c) Event Binding(DOM to component) – Enables the application to respond to user input in the target environment 
e.g. <button (click) = getData()>Click Me!</button`>

d) Two-way Binding(Both way) – Changes made in the application state gets gautomatically reflected in the view and vice-versa. 
The ngModel directive is used for achieving this type of data binding.
<input [(ngModel)]="userName"/>

Note: 
When you want to output something in your template, print some text to it, use string interpolation.
If you want to change some property, be that of HTML element or directive or component use property binding.
