1. What is NgRx?
NgRx stands for Angular Reactive Extensions.
Its a state management solution aims to help with the management of more complex state.
Used instead of managing complex state in component or in service.

2. What is State?
State is simply data that is used in one or more components in your applications that typically changes over time.
For example when user clicked button.
And where those data changes should then lead to a change in the applcation typically to a UI update.

3. Working of NgrX?
- Component dispatches action.
- Action: Action is standardized message(event) to which reducers can listen.
- Reducer: Contains state changing logic and passes data to store.
- Store:  This is where your data is stored and managed.                            
- Then this state or data is used by the component via selectors.        

7. What is NgRx Selectors?
Selectors are pure functions that receive state slices as input parameters components to consume. 
The Selectors are the ngrx/store module's query tools, similar to how databases have their own SQL query language.

8. What are the effects in ngrx?
Effects:
Side effects that should be triggered for certain actions.(e.g. send HTTP request)

9. What is the difference between NgRX and RxJS?
A: Ngrx is a redux implementation using rxjs. 
Rxjs is for handling complex asynchronous work like handling communication between client and server. 
Ngrx is for optimally storing data in the client and recalling them from all over the application, usually.
