When you build java project the war file will be generated in 
javaapp/target/javaapp.war

Just copy that war file and paste it into tomcats webapp folder at below path:
C:\Workspace\softwares\apache-tomcat-9.0.80-windows-x64\apache-tomcat-9.0.80\webapps

On Refresh javaap.war will be extracted.

Then you just start the tomcat manually from terminal at bin directory and
run command ./startup.bat

Tomcat will be started at localhost:8081. You just append your javappp name as: localhost:8081/javaapp

Your app will be running there.


If you want to do it from tomcat portal:
First you have to set user and password in tomcat-users-file as below:
apache-tomcat-9.0.80-windows-x64\apache-tomcat-9.0.80\conf\tomcat-users.xml
<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<user username="tomcat" password="s3cret" roles="manager-gui"/>

Then on portal click on Manage button and sign in using above password.

On that Tomcat Web Application Manager (http://localhost:8081/manager/html) portal find a section 'WAR file to deploy'.
There you can choose your war and click on deploy.
Your app will be listed in above section named 'Applications'.
