Challenges in manual work?
1. Dev write new code every day. Follow process every day.
2. Multiple environment
3. Time consuming
4. Error prone.

What is Dev ops:
Development + Operations

Tools to automate build and deployment
Jenkins: Automate Build and Deployment process.
It automates Commit -> Build -> Test -> Deploy proesses.


Five main environments we generally use:
Dev
QA
UAT
Pilot(Pre production)
Producion Live


What is  CI/CD?
Continuous integration: Build+Test+Deploy
Is an automation to build and test application whenever new commits are pushed into the branch.

Continuous Delivery/Deploy: Release + Build +deploy 
Continuous integration + Deploy application to production by "clicking on button" (Release to customer is often but on demand)


Process from Durgesh Lecture:
In the eclipse created maven project and generated war file.
Eclipse closed with tomcat servers.
Copied the generated war file from target folder of java project.
Pasted it into tomcats web app folder. 
When refresh there the war file is extracted.
.
Now start tomcat server:
Open cmd in bin directory and run command .\startup.bat command
Tomcat will be opened at localhost:8080/javaapp //name of the war file.
Your app will be opened there.


Now Jenkins:
Download jenkin.war file from jenkin website i.e. https://www.jenkins.io/download/
Generic Java package .war
.
You can start that jenkin using cmd command in the directory where jenkin is placed.
java -jar .\jenkins.war
