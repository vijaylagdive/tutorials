Design patterns:
.
A design patterns are well-proved solution for solving the specific problem/task.
Design patterns are programming language independent for solving the common object-oriented design problems. 
In Other Words, a design pattern represents an idea, not a particular implementation. 
Using design patterns you can make your code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable.


Types of design patterns: 
1. Creational Design Pattern
- Creational design patterns are concerned with the way of creating objects.
Example:
1. Singleton Pattern
2. Factory Pattern
3. Abstract Factory Pattern
4. Builder Pattern
5. Prototype Pattern
-------------------------------------------------
3. Structural Design Pattern
- Structural design patterns provide different ways to create a Class structure 
- For example, using inheritance and composition to create a large Object from small Objects.
Examples:
1. Adapter Pattern
2. Composite Pattern
3. Proxy Pattern
4. Flyweight Pattern
5. Facade Pattern
6. Bridge Pattern
7. Decorator Pattern
-------------------------------------------------
3. Behavioral Design Pattern
- Behavioral patterns provide a solution for better interaction between objects and how to provide loose-coupling and flexibility to extend easily.
- It ensures Interaction between objects and Loose coupling between objects.
Examples:
1. Template Method Pattern
2. Mediator Pattern
3. Chain of Responsibility Pattern
4. Observer Pattern
5. Strategy Pattern
6. Command Pattern
7. State Pattern
8. Visitor Pattern
9. Interpreter Pattern
10. Iterator Pattern
11. Memento Pattern
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Most commonly used design pattern in java.
Singleton Pattern. The singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a Class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in the Java Virtual Machine. ...
Factory Pattern. ...
Abstract Factory Pattern. ...
Builder Pattern. ...
Prototype Pattern. ...
Adapter Pattern. ...
Composite Pattern. ...
