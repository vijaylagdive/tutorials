Content1: Need of String Builder
- StringBuffer is also mutable as like StringBuffer but all its method are synchronized.
- At a time only one thread is allowed to operate on StringBuffer object. 
- It incereases waiting time of threads and hence relatively performance is low.
.
All methods available in StringBuffer avaialbale in StringBuider only difference is that they are not synchronized.
StingBuilder is non-synchronized versoin of StringBuffer.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Content2: StringBuffer vs StringBuilder
Difference1:
StringBuffer: Every method present in StringBuffer is Synchronized
String Builder: No method present in StringBuilder is synchronized

Difference2:
StringBuffer: At a time only one thread is allowed to operate on StringBuffer object. Hence String Buffer object is Thread safe.
String Builder: At a time multiple threads are allowed to operate on StringBuilder object and hence StringBuilder object is not Thread Safe.

Difference3:
StringBuffer: It incereases waiting time of threads and hence relatively performance is low.
String Builder: Threads are not required to wait to operate on StringBuilder objec and hence relatively performance is high.

Difference4:
String Buffer: Introduced in 1.0 version 
String Builder: Introduced in 1.5 version.

Content3: String vs StringBuffer vs StringBuilder
So when to use String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
1. If the content is fixed and wont change frequently then we should go for String.
2. If the content is not fixed and keep on changing but Thread safety is required then we should go for StringBuffer.
3. If the content is not fixed and keep on changing and Thread safety is not require then we should go for String Builder.
