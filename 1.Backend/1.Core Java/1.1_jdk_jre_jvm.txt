Q What is Java Development Kit (JDK):
Ans: 
- It contains JRE + development tools.
- Provides environment to develope and run java program.
- JDK is a software development environment that provides tools, libraries, and documentation for Java development.
- Source code to bytecode: It includes the Java compiler (javac) to compile Java source code into bytecode.
- Developers use the JDK to write, compile, and debug Java programs.

Q What is JRE?
JRE: 
- JDK contains the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which includes the JVM and necessary libraries to run Java applications.
- JRE contains JVM + Library classes
-------------------------------------------------
Q What is Java Virtual Machine (JVM):
Ans: Execution environment.
- The JVM is an integral part of the Java platform and acts as an execution environment for Java programs.
- JVM interprets compiled Java bytecode and translates it into machine code specific to the host system.
- It handles memory management, garbage collection, and runtime optimizations for efficient execution of Java programs.
- JVM implementations are available for various platforms, allowing Java programs to run consistently across different systems.
- The JVM abstracts the underlying hardware and operating system, providing a consistent runtime environment for Java applications across different platforms
- JVM runs code line by line.
JDK = JRE + Development tools
JRE = JVM + Library classes
