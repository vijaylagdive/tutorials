public static void main?

What if we dont write main method?
Ans:
See example without main method.
class Test 
{

}
- This code without main method will be compiled with no error.
- Compiler will not check weather main method is there or not.
- But the JVM is responsible to check main method is there or not. 
- Because it starts execution from main method only. Error: NoSuchMethod: main method.
- Wheather class contains main() method or not and whether main() method is declared according to requirement or not these things will not be checked by compiler. 
- But at runtime JVM is responsible to check these things.
- At runtime if JVM is unable to find required main methid then we will get runtime exception saying NoSuchMethidError.main
- JVM always searching for main method in prototype like: public static void main()
.
Why the format public static void main?
Ans:
Because JVM is configured like that it will only search for psvm and no other method.
why public?
To call by JVM from anywhere
why static?
Main method is a class level mehthod. 
Without existing object also JVM has to call this method and main method no way related to any object.
Why void?
main method wont return anything to JVM.
What is main(String[] args)?
main is the name which is configured inside JVM.
.
What is String[] args?
Command line arguments
.
What changes are acceptable in public static void main?
1. The order of modifiers is not important that is instead of "public static" we can take "static public" 
.
2. We can declare "String[]" in any acceptable form.
main(String[] args)
main(String []args)
mian(String args[])
.
3. Instead of 'args' we can take any valid java identifier.
.
4 We can replace String[] with var arg parameter.
main(String[] args) ==> main(String..args)
.
5. We can declare main() method with the following modifiers also.
final, synchronized, strictfp
.
So this is allowed for psvm():
class Test {
final static synchronized strictfp public void main(string... durga){
	sopen("valid void main");
}
