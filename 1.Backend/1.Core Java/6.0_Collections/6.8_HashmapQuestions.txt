Q Which data structure hashmap represent?
Ans:
Hashtable data structure.
Time Complexity O(1) if we know the key.

Q Which data structure is used to implement Hashmap in java?
Ans:
Array and Linked List.
Array for Buckets
Linked List for Mapping nodes which lands in same buckets.


Q Is hashmap threadsafe?
Ans: No

Q What will happen if you use Hashmap in a multithreaded Java application?
Ans:
When multiple threads access the hashmap then they can modify the data at sometime.
If you want to use Hashmap in multithreaded environment you can use concurrent Hashmap.

Q How do you remove a mapping while iterating over Hashmap in java?
Ans: remove() of Iterator

while(itr.hasNext()) 
{
	Map.Entry current = itr.next();
	if(current.getKey().equals("matching")) 
	{
		itr.remove();//this will remove the current key. 
	}
}

What is the load factot in Hashmap?
Its a number that controls the resizing of Hashmap.
For example 16 is the initial capacity of hashmap and .75 is the load factor.
Then when hashmap fills 12+1th element in Array it resizes the capacity of Hashmap.

How to count or get size of hashmap?
size(); //return int
mappingCount(); //return long.

What is Concurrent Hashmap?
Ans: Map implementation, which can be safely used in a concurrent and multithreaded java program.
