- It provides an easier and faster way to set up, configure, and run both simple and web-based application.
- It provides auto configuration and embeded application server like tomcat,jetty   etc.
- It basically removes a lot of configuration and dependencies.
- SpringFramework + Embeded Servers - Configurations = Spring Boot
- Absolutely no code generations and not requirement for XML configuration.
- Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration.
- This allows developers to focus more on writing business logic rather than dealing with complex setup and configuration details.


Features or Advantages:
1. Auto Configuration:
It provides auto-configuration, where common components and dependencies are automatically configured based on classpath scanning and sensible defaults.

requiring a separate web server installation.

4. Spring Boot Actuator:
Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features out of the box, such as health checks, metrics, and monitoring capabilities.
It offers a range of developer tools, including automatic restart, live reload, and a command-line interface (CLI), 
enhancing productivity during the development process.
