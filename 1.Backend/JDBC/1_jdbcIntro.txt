JDBC stands for Java Data Base Connectivity.
JDBC is a java API to connect and perform operations.(insert,delete,update,select) with the database.
JDBC API uses JDBC drivers to connect with the database.



eclipse <--> program <--> jdbc <--> driver <--> database(MySql connector.jar) <-->MySql

To connect java application with the MySql database, we need to follow 5 steps as below.

1. Load the driver class
2. Create Connection using DriverManager
3. Use connection to fire query {Statement for static queries and PreparedStatement for dynamic queries.}
4. Process the result.
5. Close the connection.



Download connector jar.
search for mysql-connector-java-5.1.0-bin.jar download
then open http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/m/Downloadmysqlconnectorjava5123binjar.htm
mysql/mysql-connector-java-5.1.23-bin.jar.zip( 806 k) and donwload it.

Create eclipse project.
Open eclipse
file new other java project.
project name StudentManagementApp
Create a Stat.java class to test everything is running.
In main method say "Welcome" and run the project.
If the project is running and you able to see Welcome then we have to add connector library.
Right click on project name -> Build path -> Configure Build Path 
Filter Java Build path Selct Libraries Tab
Click on add exteranl libraries and select downloaded library. It will be added.

You can make sure that library is added:
Below project name somewhere there is Reference libraries
You can see newly added connector library.
